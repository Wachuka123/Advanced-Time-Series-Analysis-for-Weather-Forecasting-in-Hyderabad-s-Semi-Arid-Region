## Overview

This project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques to predict agricultural weather conditions and crop water requirements in Hyderabad, India. Hyderabad, located in the semi-arid region of Telangana, experiences diverse climatic influences that significantly impact its agriculture, economy, and daily life. The city's weather patterns, including temperature variations, humidity levels, and rainfall, play a crucial role in shaping agricultural productivity and water resource management. Given the challenges posed by climate change, accurately understanding and forecasting these weather patterns are essential for effective planning and management in sectors like agriculture and water resources.

## Context

India, a nation of rich cultural and historical heritage, is characterized by diverse ethnicities, languages, and religions. It has a varied geographical landscape, ranging from the Himalayas in the north to the Deccan plateau in the south. The country experiences a tropical monsoon climate, with distinct wet and dry seasons affecting agriculture significantly. Hyderabad, as a major city in southern India, exemplifies these climatic complexities, making it an ideal study area for predicting and managing agricultural weather conditions using advanced deep learning models.

## Significance:
Understanding India's climatic diversity and its impact on agriculture is crucial for sustainable development and disaster preparedness. This project aims to contribute to this understanding by developing a predictive model that can aid farmers, policymakers, and researchers in making informed decisions regarding crop management, water resource allocation, and disaster mitigation strategies in Hyderabad and similar regions.

## Problem Statement
Accurately predicting weather conditions in Hyderabad, India, particularly critical events like droughts and extreme temperatures, remains a significant challenge. The existing models often fail to incorporate the complex interplay between time series and geospatial data, leading to less reliable forecasts. This gap in accurate weather prediction hinders effective agricultural planning and water resource management, which are crucial for sustaining the region's agrarian economy. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop an advanced predictive model that can reliably forecast weather conditions by integrating various data types and capturing intricate weather patterns. This study aims to address this need by utilizing deep learning techniques to improve prediction accuracy and provide actionable insights for stakeholders.

## Research Statement
The research aims to leverage deep learning techniques to develop a robust predictive model for weather conditions in Hyderabad. By incorporating both time series and geospatial data, the study will explore trends, patterns, and correlations among various weather parameters. The primary focus will be on predicting critical weather events, such as droughts and extreme temperatures, and understanding their impact on crop water requirements. This research will not only contribute to the scientific community's understanding of weather dynamics in the semi-arid tropics but also provide valuable insights for agricultural planning and water resource management in the region.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Data Point


The dataset originates from Hyderabad, India. Notably, all the longitudes and latitudes are identical (17.508409, 78.2723), which suggests the weather data was collected from a single location or observation point within Hyderabad. This is an important factor to consider when analyzing the data, as it might not represent weather conditions across the entire city.

### Correlation Heatmap

![image-1](https://github.com/WanjuguN/Phase-4_Group-4-Project/assets/151353695/4b5fae9c-00ef-41d4-8f9e-4b7d39d517b8)

The figures represent a correlation matrix for several weather-related variables. Each value shows the Pearson correlation coefficient between pairs of variables. A value of 1.0 indicates a perfect positive correlation, -1.0 indicates a perfect negative correlation, and 0 indicates no correlation. For instance, MaxT (maximum temperature) has a strong positive correlation with Evap (evaporation) at 0.876, meaning higher temperatures are associated with higher evaporation rates. Conversely, MaxT has a strong negative correlation with RH1 (relative humidity in the morning) at -0.737, indicating that higher temperatures tend to occur with lower morning humidity. MinT (minimum temperature) shows moderate correlations with several variables, like MaxT at 0.537 and FAO56_ET (reference crop evapotranspiration) at 0.505. Rainfall (Rain) has weaker correlations with most variables, with the highest being a moderate positive correlation with RH2 (relative humidity in the afternoon) at 0.356. SSH (bright sunshine hours) negatively correlates with both relative humidity measures and positively with variables like Radiation at 0.744, suggesting that more sunshine is linked with higher radiation levels but lower humidity. Overall, the matrix reveals how different climatic variables are interrelated, highlighting both direct and inverse relationships.

### Identifying any weather patterns in Hyderabad - Kmeans clustering
#### K_means clustering

![image-2](https://github.com/WanjuguN/Phase-4_Group-4-Project/assets/151353695/57a245e8-a5de-4925-acf4-ddfabff05beb)

The output is a scatter plot showing the results of KMeans clustering applied to a dataset that has been reduced to two principal components using PCA. Each point represents a data sample, plotted according to its values on the first two principal components. The colors indicate the clusters assigned by the KMeans algorithm, with three distinct clusters visible (yellow, purple, and teal). The red 'X' markers represent the centroids of each cluster, which are the central points calculated by the KMeans algorithm. These centroids are used to assign each data point to a cluster based on the shortest Euclidean distance to the centroid. This visualization helps to understand the separation and distribution of the clusters in a two-dimensional space. The clear separation between the colors indicates that the KMeans algorithm has effectively partitioned the data into three clusters.

#### Time Series

The plot shows a highly variable pattern with occasional spikes indicating periods of heavy rainfall. Notably, there is a significant spike around the year 2000, suggesting an exceptionally high rainfall event. Hyderabad reported significant rainfall in 2000. News reports and historical accounts mention heavy downpours, particularly in August 2000.

***Shade Structures:*** Consider temporary shade for sensitive crops during peak heat months to avoid heat stress.

### Rainfall by Month

***Peak Rainfall:*** Significant rain falls in June, July, and August, often exceeding 100 mm.

***Dry Periods:*** Minimal rainfall occurs in January, February, and March.

#### Recommendations:

***Planting Schedule:*** Plan planting before the rainy season (April) for rain-fed crops to ensure sufficient water for germination.

***Water Conservation:*** Implement rainwater harvesting during peak rainfall to store water for dry periods.

***Soil Erosion Prevention:*** Use cover crops, contour farming, and maintain vegetation cover to minimize soil erosion.
